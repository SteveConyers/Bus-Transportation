# Bus-Transportation
SQL Database for Bus Routes

This SQL project is the final project that was done in my SQL Database, Design and Implementation course from college. It demonstrates my knowledge of SQL and designing and creating a database for "real world" use.
This project is based off my cities local public transportation by bus. It uses drivers, pass holders, billing, etc. All data is from 2022.
Included in the repository, there are the SQL database files to create the database, alter, drop and more. Also includes a text file of the database in 3NF (third normal form) and a powerpoint presentation of the database as if I were presenting this to management, senior level DBAs and coworkers.
